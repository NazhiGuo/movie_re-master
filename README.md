## ðŸš€ Features

- **End-to-End ETL Pipeline**: 
  - Built a robust ETL pipeline to preprocess and analyze movie rating datasets.
  - Conducted online analytical processing (**OLAP**) using **Spark SQL**.

- **Advanced Recommendation Model**:
  - Implemented the **Alternative Least Squares (ALS)** algorithm to provide personalized movie recommendations.
  - Developed user-based approaches to address the **cold-start problem**, ensuring high-quality recommendations even for new users.

- **Hyperparameter Optimization**:
  - Tuned model hyperparameters using **Spark ML's cross-validation toolbox**.
  - Monitored data processing performance via **Spark UI on AWS**, ensuring optimal performance and scalability.
